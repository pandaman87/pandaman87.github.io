				<li>Many Eons ago, back in the dark ages, or what most youngsters would now 
			consider the early to mid 2000’s, there was a news aggregation website that 
			had quite a bit of traffic. That website is Digg or rather digg.com. I 
			confess, that I do not know if Digg receives more traffic than Reddit, 
			which seems to be the preferred method of information gather amongst my
			 generation. With all of that said Digg’s technology stack is something 
			 that is what concerns us today.</li>
					
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					
					<li>In terms of the technology specifications of digg.com there were not documents 
	that were publically available 
	about what kind of power any of their servers had. With that said Digg does have 
	something interesting going on 
	in terms of the kind of open source software it uses. 
	“Digg.com credits two particular features of its LAMP 
	(Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) server cluster for helping the news aggregation 
	site maintain speedy performance in the face of high growth.<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2544850/enterprise-
	applications/how-digg-com-uses-the-lamp-stack-to-scale-upward.html">(Computer World)</a>” 
	Now LAMP may not 
	sound that impressive, but consider that fact that most of that most of the software
	 being used in that cluster is technically open source, so they do not really have to 
	 worry about paying that much for it.</li>
				
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				
				<li>MySQL is used as their database software while, PHP is what scripting language 
	of choice for Digg, so Javascipt seems 
	to be nowhere in sight. What is also interesting about the kind of technology that 
	Digg uses is that it employs special 
	software for distributed computing<a href="http://www.developerfusion.com/news/91331/a-look-behind-
	the-numbers-on-digg-and-stack-overflow/">(Developer Fusion)</a>. “The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework 
	that allows for the distributed
	 processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming 
	 models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, 
	 each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver 
	 high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at 
	 the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster 
	 of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.<a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/#What+Is+Apache+Hadoop%3F">
	 (Apache.org)</a>” The ability to scale 
	 software is important because Digg would want to have their software scale so they
	  could grow or shrink as technology and the company demanded.</li>
	  
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  
	
	<li>In fact “Today, Digg.com boasts 100 servers scattered in multiple data centers 
	that host a total of 30GB of data, but the site started off in late 2004 as a 
	single Linux server running Apache 1.3, PHP 4, and MySQL 4.0 using the default
	 MyISAM storage engine,<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2544850/enterprise-
	applications/how-digg-com-uses-the-lamp-stack-to-scale-upward.html">(Computer world)</a>”. 
	Having software that can scale would be a great benefit 
	 to a company that would want to expand beyond that number of servers.</li>
		
		<br>
		<br>	
		<br>
	
	<li>The final aspect of that has to addressed is what kind of servers Digg.com is using 
	and how many of them there are. “Digg’s current architecture includes about 20 
	database servers, 30 Web servers, and a few search servers running Lucene; the
	 balance operate as backup servers. All but one of the database servers run some 
	 version of MySQL 5.<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2544850/enterprise-
	applications/how-digg-com-uses-the-lamp-stack-to-scale-upward.html">(Computer world)</a>” 
	The Lucene that is mentioned in that quote is a “free open 
	 source information retrieval software library.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucene">(Wikipedia)</a>” 
	 Digg has the backbone to handle 
	 the kind of traffic it gets from millions of users. This information is out of date 
	 by a few years, so the infrastructure the have installed with LAMP has been scaled 
	 to a larger size allowing Digg to start scaling to a larger amount of servers. 
	 Thank you for your time and have a great day!</li>
